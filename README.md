# 🛒 MarketPlaceX

**MarketPlaceX** is a full-stack marketplace web application that allows users to register, list products, view others’ listings, express interest, send messages, and place orders — similar to Blocket or Facebook Marketplace.

The goal is to simulate a modern e-commerce platform with separate admin and user roles, built using **Vue.js**, **Spring Boot**, and **TypeScript**.
